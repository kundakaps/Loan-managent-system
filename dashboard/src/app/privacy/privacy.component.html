                        <p>Welcome to Traveller's Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.</p>
                        <p>
                            We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. Let's starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This
                            Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
                        </p>
                        <h2>1. Who We Are.</h2>
                        <p>
                            If you live in southern part of Africa, the company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “data controller”) is Kapakala Technologies
                        </p>
                        <h2>2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h2>
                        <p>
                            This Privacy Policy applies to websites and apps offered by Traveller. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we've added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
                        </p>
                        <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
                        <p>
                            It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information
                            from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
                        </p>
                        <p>Information you give us</p>
                        <p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures, you
                                may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual
                                orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial
                                information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your
                                request.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Information we receive from others</p>

                            In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:

                        <ul>

                                Social Media You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Tinder account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your
                                social media account with us.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Other Partners We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Tinder ads are published on a partner's websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign's success).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                Other information with your consent If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The
                                collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren't using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation,
                                we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo,).

                        <h2>4. Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies</h2>
                        <p>
                            We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analysing site traffic and trends, delivering
                            and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives
                            a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including
                            Tinder, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

                        <h2>7. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
                        <p>
                            We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect,
                            that your personal information will always remain secure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to ensure that our systems and your information are protected against unauthorized access, theft and loss, we implemented a bug bounty program.
